# BBC-micro-bit-Group-Project Overview
This project allows data communication between two BBC micro:bit devices, and a computer so that  data can be stored and visualised via a Python script. Data collected includes temperature, humidity, walking or running speed and steps taken.

# Highlights
- **Data transfer** from micro:bit devices to Python using UART and device IDs.
- **Interactivity** with devices through buttons being mapped to functions; for example, a button for sending data from devices to computer.
- **Visualisation of data** using serial connections for reading data, and then modules such as pandas, plotly and matplotlib for creating graphs to showcase this data.
